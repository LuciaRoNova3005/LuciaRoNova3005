## Hi 👋 I´m Lucía 

 ## Front-end developer || Desarrollador web ⚡ 

💭 With training in advertising and audiovisual production after working on IT projects, my interest in programming was awakened and I was encouraged to do a  **bootcamp in front-end development**

I just finished @Adalab Bootcamp and learned:

+ HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap;
+ JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
+ Version control with Git;
+ Creation of SPAs with React;
+ Node JS and Express.

✨ I consider myself a creative worker, **with good humor and used to teamwork**
#### 😄 Two heads think better than one! 😄
